# Java-OCA-Pracs

## 📚 Java OCA Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Java OCA Practice Repository**! This collection of mini-projects is designed to help you master core Java concepts and prepare for the **Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE Programmer** certification.

Each subproject focuses on a different topic, such as object-oriented programming, arrays, control flow, encapsulation, and more — aligning with the official OCA exam objectives.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A **learning lab** for Java fundamentals and OCA certification topics  
- A **reference** for frequently used Java patterns and techniques  
- A **personal portfolio** of Java projects for self-assessment and growth  
- A **Git practice** playground for working with version control in a real-world structure

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
Java-OCA-Pracs/
├── Java-Student-Management/     # OOP with constructors, toString, pass/fail logic
├── Java-Encapsulation-Practice/ # Future: Practice with private fields, getters/setters
├── Java-Array-Practice/         # Future: Learn Java arrays and loop manipulation
├── Java-Loop-Practice/          # Future: for, while, do-while loop practice
└── README.md                    # This file
```

Each subfolder contains:
- `src/`: All Java source code
- `README.md`: Description and instructions for that project
- `.gitignore`: Optional, specific to that project
- `*.iml`: IntelliJ project/module files (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java SE (JDK 11, 17, or 21)
- IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended IDE)
- Git (for version control)
- Terminal or Command Line (for compiling and running)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-OCA-Pracs.git
cd Java-OCA-Pracs
```

2. Navigate to a Subproject
```bash
cd Java-Student-Management
```

3. Compile and Run the Code
```bash
cd src
javac Main.java myStudent.java
java Main
```

💡 Most projects will follow this structure unless otherwise noted in their README files.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add more practice projects: Arrays, Loops, Inheritance, Exception Handling, etc.
- Use Lists and Collections for dynamic object storage
- Introduce file input/output operations
- Add user input with Scanner
- Prepare mock OCA-style questions
